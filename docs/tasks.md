## Notes
- Each phase should be completed with full test coverage before moving to the next
- Regular security audits should be performed
- Performance benchmarks should be established and monitored
- Documentation should be updated with each phase completion
- Simulator configurations should be version controlled
- All simulator test scenarios must be documented
- Regular validation against OCPP specification required
