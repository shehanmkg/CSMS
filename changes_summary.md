# Changes to Fix MicroOCPP Simulator Connection

## 1. WebSocket Server Changes

1. **Simplified Implementation**:
   - Switched to a class-based WebSocketServer implementation
   - Removed complex protocol validation and negotiation
   - Simplified connection handling

2. **Protocol Handling**:
   - Accepted the first protocol provided by the client
   - Added more robust protocol negotiation with better logging

3. **Path Parsing**:
   - Improved URL path parsing to extract chargePointId
   - Handled various URL formats for compatibility with the simulator

4. **Connection Management**:
   - Added proper connection tracking with Map
   - Implemented ping-pong mechanism for connection monitoring
   - Added clean connection termination and resource cleanup

## 2. Integration Changes

1. **Server Structure**:
   - Updated to have both HTTP and WebSocket servers use the same port
   - Implemented standalone and HTTP-attached modes for the WebSocket server

2. **Error Handling**:
   - Improved error logging and reporting
   - Added proper error propagation

3. **Simulator Compatibility**:
   - Updated simulator guide with precise connection instructions
   - Added troubleshooting steps for connection issues

## 3. Testing Infrastructure

1. **API Endpoints**:
   - Added `/api/stations` to view all connected stations
   - Added `/api/stations/:id` to view specific station details

2. **Logging**:
   - Enhanced logging for better debugging
   - Added detailed connection and message logs

3. **Simulation Testing**:
   - Successfully tested with MicroOCPP simulator
   - Verified BootNotification, Heartbeat, and StatusNotification operations

## Results

- The CSMS server now successfully accepts connections from the MicroOCPP simulator
- All OCPP operations are processed and logged correctly
- Station data is properly stored and accessible via the API
- The system is ready for implementation of additional OCPP operations
