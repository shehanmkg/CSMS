# Changes to Fix MicroOCPP Simulator Connection

## 1. WebSocket Server Changes

1. **Simplified Implementation**:
   - Switched to a class-based WebSocketServer implementation
   - Removed complex protocol validation and negotiation
   - Simplified connection handling

2. **Protocol Handling**:
   - Accepted the first protocol provided by the client
   - Added more robust protocol negotiation with better logging

3. **Path Parsing**:
   - Improved URL path parsing to extract chargePointId
   - Handled various URL formats for compatibility with the simulator

4. **Connection Management**:
   - Added proper connection tracking with Map
   - Implemented ping-pong mechanism for connection monitoring
   - Added clean connection termination and resource cleanup

## 2. Integration Changes

1. **Server Structure**:
   - Updated to have both HTTP and WebSocket servers use the same port
   - Implemented standalone and HTTP-attached modes for the WebSocket server

2. **Error Handling**:
   - Improved error logging and reporting
   - Added proper error propagation

3. **Simulator Compatibility**:
   - Updated simulator guide with precise connection instructions
   - Added troubleshooting steps for connection issues

## 3. Testing Infrastructure

1. **API Endpoints**:
   - Added `/api/stations` to view all connected stations
   - Added `/api/stations/:id` to view specific station details

2. **Logging**:
   - Enhanced logging for better debugging
   - Added detailed connection and message logs

3. **Simulation Testing**:
   - Successfully tested with MicroOCPP simulator
   - Verified BootNotification, Heartbeat, and StatusNotification operations

## Results

- The CSMS server now successfully accepts connections from the MicroOCPP simulator
- All OCPP operations are processed and logged correctly
- Station data is properly stored and accessible via the API
- The system is ready for implementation of additional OCPP operations

# Changes Summary

## Dashboard Implementation

We have successfully implemented a modern, responsive dashboard for the Charging Station Management System (CSMS). The dashboard provides comprehensive monitoring and analytics capabilities for EV charging stations and transactions.

### Features Implemented:

1. **Station Monitoring**
   - Real-time display of all charging stations
   - Status indicators for each station (Available, Charging, Faulted, etc.)
   - Detailed view of station information including vendor, model, and connector status
   - Filtering and search capabilities

2. **Transaction Tracking**
   - List of all charging transactions
   - Real-time status indicators
   - Energy consumption and duration tracking
   - Filtering by active/completed status and search functionality

3. **Analytics and Insights**
   - Energy consumption chart over time
   - Station utilization metrics
   - Status distribution visualization
   - Key metrics like average session duration and peak usage times

4. **Technical Implementation**
   - RESTful API endpoints for retrieving station and transaction data
   - Real-time data updates with automatic refresh
   - Responsive design for desktop and mobile devices
   - Modular JavaScript architecture for maintainability

### Files Created:

- **HTML**: `src/public/index.html` - Main dashboard interface
- **CSS**: `src/public/css/styles.css` - Styling for the dashboard
- **JavaScript**:
  - `src/public/js/dashboard.js` - Core functionality and state management
  - `src/public/js/stations.js` - Station listing and details
  - `src/public/js/transactions.js` - Transaction listing and details
  - `src/public/js/analytics.js` - Charts and analytics
- **Assets**: `src/public/favicon.svg` - Dashboard favicon

### API Endpoints Added:

- `/api/stations` - Get all charging stations
- `/api/transactions` - Get all transactions
- `/api/stations/:chargePointId/transactions` - Get transactions for a specific station

### Next Steps:

- Integrate with persistent storage for historical data
- Enhance authentication for secure access
- Add user management functionality
- Improve real-time updates with WebSocket integration
- Add email/SMS notifications for critical events
